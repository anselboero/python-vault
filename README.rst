Python-Vault - The Veeva Vault SDK for Python
===========================================



Unofficial Veeva Vault SDK (Software Development Kit) for Python
----------------------------------------------------------------


vault-python-sdk is an unofficial Python Veeva Vault API wrapper that aims to enhance development for those working with Veeva Cloud.

I'm in no way affiliated with Veeva. Use at your own risk.

My personal goal is to speed up migrations to the Veeva Cloud by allowing the use of Python as the main programming language. 

The next plan is the creation of an Apache airflow provider based on this SDK. 
The creation of a Python SDK and an Apache Airflow Provider will allow the developer to work with Open-Source and 
very popular tools in the Data Engineering world.
