Python-Vault - The Veeva Vault SDK for Python
===========================================



Unofficial Veeva Vault SDK (Software Development Kit) for Python
----------------------------------------------------------------


python-vault is an unofficial Python Veeva Vault API wrapper that aims to enhance development for those working with Veeva Cloud.

I'm in no way affiliated with Veeva. Use at your own risk.

My personal goal is to speed up migrations to the Veeva Cloud by allowing the use of Python as the main programming language. 

Python is the main programming language used by data engineers and data scientists. 
By using this wrapper it is possible to integrate and leverage Veeva Data with the main Python Frameworks, such as Pyspark, Apache Airflow, Pandas.
